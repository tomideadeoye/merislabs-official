**What are two personality traits you have that former teammates do not like about you?**

- Urgency and Frankness.

**Describe your most significant experience relating to entrepreneurship.**

One of my most significant entrepreneurial experiences was leading the development of VerifyPro, a project during my time at the Nigerian University of Technology and Management (NUTM). VerifyPro aimed to combat real estate fraud in Nigeria by providing a platform for individuals to verify the authenticity of property titles.

This project was a collaborative effort between myself and four other team members, with each of us taking on different roles such as software development, marketing, and operations. I led the software development, creating a non-relational database and a map-based dashboard using React and Firebase to map geospatial data to property titles. This project was well-received by our industry mentors and showcased my ability to lead a team, coordinate with industry stakeholders, and develop innovative solutions to real-world problems.

**Tell us about a time you led a team, what was your biggest success factor?**

As the CTO of a prop-tech startup, I led a team of four in developing VerifyPro, a platform designed to map geospatial data to property titles in Nigeria. One of the key success factors was effective communication and coordination with industry stakeholders, which included government officials and real estate professionals.

I also focused on inspiring my team to think creatively and providing guidance to build their confidence and skills. By fostering an environment of collaboration and open communication, we were able to successfully develop a product that addressed a significant issue in the Nigerian real estate market. Our ability to work together efficiently and stay focused on our goals was crucial to our success.

**Describe one common mistake you think too many tech startup founders make while building companies.**

One common mistake many tech startup founders make is failing to validate their ideas as soon as possible. It is essential to achieve market acceptance early in the development process, which can be accomplished through market research and launching minimum viable products (MVPs).

In my last startup, I made the mistake of spending too much time perfecting the technology instead of rolling out an MVP and iterating based on market feedback. This delayed our ability to understand our customers’ needs and adapt our product accordingly. Learning from this experience, I now prioritize early validation and rapid iteration to ensure that the product meets market demands effectively.

**Describe one problem you hope to solve with tech and software.**

I am incredibly excited about the potential of using technology and software to revolutionize the venture capital industry. One major problem I hope to solve is the time-consuming process of assessing the quality of ideas for investment.

By implementing AI-generated investment memos and shared pipelines across multiple venture capital firms, we can streamline the evaluation process and make quicker, more informed investment decisions. This approach would make it easier for funds to access information from startups, conduct due diligence efficiently, and ultimately result in more successful investments and a thriving tech ecosystem.

**What do you think would be your biggest challenge in trying to tackle this problem with your software?**

One of the biggest challenges in tackling this problem with software is competition. The venture capital space is a high-priority target for many startups, so scaling the solution quickly to maintain a first-mover advantage is crucial.

To address this, I plan to solidify relationships with venture capital funds and increase the switching cost for funds by adding more features to the product. These features will be designed to enhance the user experience and make the solution indispensable to VC firms. Additionally, ensuring the security and reliability of the AI-generated insights will be essential to gain and maintain trust from users.

**How would you monetize this solution?**

I believe a subscription-based service could be a viable way to generate revenue from this idea. By offering VC firms access to the platform for a fee, we could provide them with custom reports, advanced due diligence capabilities, and integration with other tools and services.

There is also potential to expand the platform to include other users and revenue streams, such as charging startups for access to improve their chances of securing funding. Providing additional value-added services, such as market analysis and trend prediction, could further enhance the platform’s appeal and profitability.

**Describe an important and out-of-the-ordinary achievement in your life.**

An important and out-of-the-ordinary achievement in my life is my journey from a non-STEM background to becoming a software engineer with a deep understanding of the tech industry.

I have gone the extra mile to learn and improve my skills, enabling me to develop products that solve real-world problems. This transition has allowed me to work with several organizations in different capacities, such as KPMG, PwC, Smart Contract Research Forum, Providus, and VFD.

I have collaborated with various businesses to build innovative products like VerifyPro and Dexter Dashboard, and I have utilized my skills in data engineering to assist small businesses in automating processes. Through my initiatives, I have provided valuable insights to companies, organizations, and startups, making a positive impact on the world.

**Describe a situation where you failed in achieving your goal. What did you learn from it?**

Building VerifyPro was a situation where I failed to achieve my goal of starting a successful business in the Nigerian land registration space. One of the key challenges was the need to have buy-in from the government to release data on ownership of title documents.

I learned the importance of understanding the problem and conducting thorough user research before diving into development. I also realized the significance of communication with stakeholders, developing a strong team, and understanding the regulatory environment. Furthermore, I learned the importance of having the right resources and expertise to tackle the problem effectively. Lastly, I learned that hard work, perseverance, and resilience are crucial in overcoming obstacles and achieving success.

## **What does your current 5-year plan look like?**

**1 . Skill Development and Certification**

- I plan to deepen my expertise in software engineering and data science, with a focus on completing my AWS Developer Certification.
- I will continue to build on my blockchain development experience, particularly in Blockchain and DeFi research.

**2. Professional Growth and Collaboration**

- I aim to collaborate with diverse startups and organizations, both within Nigeria and internationally, to drive innovation in product development, analytics, and strategy.
- Expanding my leadership and management capabilities is a priority, with the goal of mentoring emerging talent in the tech industry and fostering a community of developers and data scientists across Africa.

**3. Entrepreneurship and Legal Pursuits**

- I will launch startups focused on the legal industry and education sector, addressing key challenges within these fields.
- Following this, I intend to attend the Nigerian Law School to obtain the Nigerian equivalent of a JD, ultimately establishing a law firm dedicated to the tech industry and pioneering smart legal contracts in Nigeria.

## **What has changed since?**

Since my time at NUTM, I have developed my data engineering skills and applied this knowledge to real-world projects, such as stock analysis, sourcing funding opportunities for NGOs, and predicting Nigerian real estate prices. I worked with industry mentors to formulate strategies for product development.

At the Smart Contract Research Forum (SCRF) in Canada, I gained valuable experience as a Research Fellow, reviewing academic papers, identifying the best industry applications, and writing on business models of decentralized finance platforms. I wrote several technical research papers on blockchain technology, including topics such as the business model of DeFi platforms, Ethereum vulnerabilities, and vulnerability countermeasures to Transaction Ordering Dependence and oracle manipulation attacks.

My time at Web3Bridge exposed me to the requirements of building on different blockchains through my blockchain development learning, which has been a valuable experience for me.

**What motivates you to pursue venture capital in Africa?**

I am passionate about technology venture capital in Sub-Saharan Africa because I believe that the region has immense potential to create innovative solutions to the world’s most pressing problems. My experience in software engineering, consulting, and research has equipped me with the skills to develop, manage, and analyze products that solve real-world problems. I have a deep understanding of the African context and its regulatory implications, which I believe is essential for any venture capital firm in the region.

I am also excited by the prospect of working with startups across all stages of their lifecycle. My experience in investment research, consulting, and legal has given me the ability to actively work with investors and create organizational management structures for startups. My diverse background and unique set of skills make me a highly qualified candidate to function in multiple facets of a startup.

I am eager to deploy my expertise in engineering, finance, legal, and consulting to help businesses achieve their goals and succeed in their respective industries. I am confident that my passion for startups and problem-solving, as well as my readiness to tackle compelling business issues, will be of great value to any venture capital firm in Sub-Saharan Africa.

**How has your diverse background contributed to your success?**

My diverse background in software engineering, business, and data analytics has provided me with a unique skill set that has been instrumental in my success. I have a wealth of experience in many facets of product development and marketing, and I have utilized my data engineering and business skills in several commercial scenarios, such as building products like Dexter Dashboard and VerifyPro.

My leadership roles have involved liaising with industry stakeholders in banking and government, which has given me valuable insights into the business challenges faced by various industries. Additionally, my experience in organizations like PwC, KPMG, Smart Contract Research Forum, Providus, VFD, and startups across all stages of their lifecycle has given me a unique blend of skills that allow me to excel in strategy, management, and analytics.

Overall, my diverse background and unique set of skills have enabled me to make meaningful contributions to the organizations I have worked with, and I am eager to continue leveraging my expertise to help businesses achieve their goals and succeed in their respective industries.
